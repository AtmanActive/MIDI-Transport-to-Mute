# MIDI-Transport-to-Mute

This directory contains extra goodies for [Reaper](https://reaper.fm) to enable true Studio Talkback functionality.

## JSFX

There is a modified volume control JS effect for Reaper which is used for dimming the monitoring FX chain volume, but with the added benefit of auto-resetting to 0dB on each and every transport action (stop, play, record), thus making sure talkback dimming can't get stuck in an unwanted state.

The name of the file is [monitoring_fx_talkback_dimmer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtmanActive/MIDI-Transport-to-Mute/refs/heads/main/Extras/Reaper/monitoring_fx_talkback_dimmer). To add it to your Reaper, just copy-paste the file to Reaper/Effects directory. Then run Reaper and add this effect to your Monitoring FX Chain.

## ReaLearn

The other piece of the puzzle is [ReaLearn](https://www.helgoboss.org/projects/realearn) which is a plug-in for Reaper to enable system-wide automation.

Once you have ReaLearn installed in your Reaper, add a ReaLearn instance to your Monitoring FX and import the file [ReaLearn TalkBack Instance.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtmanActive/MIDI-Transport-to-Mute/refs/heads/main/Extras/Reaper/ReaLearn%20TalkBack%20Instance.json) from this repository into it.

The ReaLearn configuration is set to receive MIDI messages from MIDI-Transport-to-Mute.exe and to automate monitoring_fx_talkback_dimmer to lower the volume while talkback is active and to bring it back to unity gain when talkback is inactive.
