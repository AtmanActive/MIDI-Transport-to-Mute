# MIDI-Transport-to-Mute

A windows app to mute an audio input based on incoming Mackie Transport Control (MTC) MIDI signals.

## Preparation

Install a virtual MIDI cable software like [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) or [Bome Network](https://www.bome.com/products/bomenet) or similar. 
Create two virtual MIDI cables, one will be MTC input, the other one MTC output. 
Go to windows "Sound"->"Recording" control panel and rename your microphone input device to "MicInput" 
by double-clicking on the device, typing the name and clicking OK. 

## Running
Start your DAW, send MTC output to one virtual cable. 
You can put the MTC input on the other cable, or leave it blank, if your DAW would allow. 
Do not use one and the same MIDI cable for both MTC input and output in your DAW, that would only create a loopback. 
Start this app, choose the MIDI port you assigned to MTC output previously as this app's input.

Now, whenever you press play in your DAW, your microphone should be muted which is indicated by 
the tray icon color change to red. As soon as you press stop in your DAW, your microphone will be 
unmuted which is indicated by the green tray icon.
